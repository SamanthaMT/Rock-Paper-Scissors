# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction
Rock paper scissors is a two-person hand game in which players simultaneously create shapes with their hands, aiming for their shape to defeat their opponent's. The possible shapes are rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), and scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended and separated to form a 'V').

## Rules
The aim of the game is to score more points than your opponent. Each round offers 1 point, which is awarded based on the shapes presented by the players.

* Rock beats scissors
* Paper beats rock
* Scissors beats paper

If both players select the same shape, there is a tie and no points are won that round.

## Algorithm
1. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 3 to determine their shape played. 1 is for rock, 2 is for paper and 3 is for scissors.
2. User selects their shape.
3. The two shapes are compared to determine whether there is a winner.
4. The winner is announced or a tie is declared.
